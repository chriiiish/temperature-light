## The Moving Parts
This project has a few moving parts:

1. [**The Lamp**](lamp/README.md)  
   This is the hardware/firmware/software of the physical lamp
   
2. [**The Backend**](backend/README.md)  
   This is the AWS infrastructure that connects up the lamp and stores temperature data
   
4. [**The Frontend**](frontend/README.md)  
   This is the Angular site that lets you explore the temperature data over time
